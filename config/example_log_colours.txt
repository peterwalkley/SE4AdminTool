# This file allows you to colour the text in the log window.  Normal text and player chat are handled by
# these first two entries.
#
# The color can be specified in several ways, refer to:
#     https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/paint/Color.html#web-java.lang.String-
#

default = gray
chat = steelblue


# These entries allow you to match specific text in the log window to a colour. Set the text you want to match,
# followed by '#', followed by the colour you wish to be matched.  Note that the FIRST match found will be used
# so set your most specific matches first.
#
# The text to match can be a regular expression. Refer to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html
# for the full specification of what is available.
